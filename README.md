## Scripts

* **npm run build** to run eslint and build the es6 and es5 umd versions of your lib into `dist`
* **npm test** to run tests
* **npm run test:watch** to watch `src` and `tests` and re-run tests
* **npm start** add whatever you need there

## ESLint

I added airbnb standard as quite a strict one, from which you can go down to
whatever suits you.
